# Hotel Booking Cancelation Analysis

Context: 
This dataset contains 119390 observations for a City Hotel and a Resort Hotel. Each observation represents a hotel booking between the 1st of July 2015 and 31st of August 2017, including bookings that effectively arrived and bookings that were canceled.

Content: 
Since this is hotel real data, all data elements pertaining to hotel or customer identification were deleted.
Four Columns, 'name', 'email', 'phone number', and 'credit_card' have been artificially created and added to the dataset.

Acknowledgments: 
The data is originally from the article Hotel Booking Demand Datasets, written by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief, Volume 22, February 2019.

Performed an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning on a hotel booking dataset in Jupyter Notebook. Here's a summary of the steps took:

1. Importing Libraries: Imported necessary libraries, including pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.

2. Importing Data: Loaded the hotel booking data from a CSV file by Kaggle.

3. EDA, Data Cleaning and Analysis:
   - Checking the dataset including the dimensions (shape) and columns of the dataset.
   - Checked data types and provided an overview of the data.
   - Converted the columns to accurate data types.
   - Checked mathematical and object data type summaries.
   - Checked unique values in object columns.
   - Checked for missing values and made necessary adjustments.
   - Dealing with outliers column.
   - Calculated and displayed the various reasons for cancellation.
   - Created various plots about findings that correlated with cancelations
   - Analyzed the top 10 countries with the most cancellations using a pie chart.
   - Explored the distribution of bookings by market segment.
   - Examined the distribution of cancellations by market segment.
